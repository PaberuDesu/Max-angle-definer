## Max angle of a convex quadrangle definer
### Program description
The program gets as input the coordinates of four points on a plane. If it is possible to create a convex quadrangle, 
program returns the largest angle of the figure. Else it returns zero.
### Tests description
There are three unit tests that help to check if:

- max angle is correct
- program can recognize three collinear points and know that the figure is not convex quadrangle
- program can define that it isn't possible to create a convex quadrangle (if one of points is inside the triangle formed by other points)
